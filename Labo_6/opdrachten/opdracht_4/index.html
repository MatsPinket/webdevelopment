                    <li><h2>Lofi</h2>
                    <p>Lo-fi represents a subgenre of electronic music that shares qualities with downtempo music,<br>
                        the chillwave scene, and lo-fi hip-hop. Lo-fi music mixed elements of house, jazz, easy listening,<br>
                        and hip-hop beats and samples with a DIY music aesthetic that emphasized the imperfect,<br>
                        homemade quality of analog recordings. The result was dreamy audio with a relaxed,<br>
                        retro sound that many found ideal for background music, especially studying.</p>

                    <li><h2>Jazz</h2>
                        <p>Jazz is a distinctively American style of music that developed in the early decades of the 20th century.<br>
                            Its roots include many Afro-American folk music traditions, such as spirituals, work songs,<br>
                            and blues. It also borrowed from 19th century band music and the ragtime style of piano playing.<br>
                            The distinctive elements of jazz include characteristic rhythm patterns, harmonic practices related to,<br>
                            but not identical with, functional harmony, and the practice of improvisation. Jazz has influenced,<br>
                            and has been influenced by, traditional classical music and popular music.<br>
                            The boundaries are not always especially clear. Although jazz has a relatively short history,<br>
                            it has developed several distinct styles with which nonspecialists should be at least superficially familiar.</p>

                    <li><h2>Cynthwave</h2>
                        <p>Synthwave is a microgenre of electronic music that draws predominantly from 1980s films,<br>
                            video games, and cartoons, as well as composers such as John Carpenter, Jean-Michel Jarre,<br>
                            Vangelis, and Tangerine Dream. Other reference points include electronic dance music genres including house,<br>
                            synth, and nu-disco.</p>
