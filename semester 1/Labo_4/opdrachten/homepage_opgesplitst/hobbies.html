          <h3>fitness</h3>
          I started working out for my mental health, but have since been working out for a better body shape too.<br>
          I go to the <a href="https://www.basic-fit.com/">basic fit</a> in Marke, where most of my gym buddies go as well.<br><br>

          <h3>art</h3>
          In high school I followed an art course, but I have been making art since I was a little kid.<br>
          Through those 6 years of <a href="https://www.athena-school.be/onze-school/campus-pottelberg">high school</a> I realised I love making art as a hobby.<br>
          Recently I started making digital art and I love it.<br><br>
          - My most recent painting I made for my grandma's 80th birthday<br>

          <h3>enjoying nature</h3>
          I am one to often go out in nature.<br>
          I just love going to places where there is no human presence.<br>
          My dream is to one day travel the world in a <a href="https://www.buildwithrise.com/stories/what-is-a-skoolie-home-a-complete-guide">skoolie</a> before settling somewhere.<br>
          But I love the nature in my surroundings as well.<br>
          There is so much to be seen in "<a href="https://www.natuurenbos.be/preshoekbos">het Preshoekbos</a>" where I live.<br><br>
